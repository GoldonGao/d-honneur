 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Shaken by Revolution"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Socialist Revolution in 1920 completely reshaped British politics. As the Empire was in free fall, a string of Prime Ministers turned in their resignations; Parliament turned to the last bastion of stability in the country - The Monarchy. \nHowever, Britain's restablization from the brink of collapse had led many to question the need for the emergency powers of the monarch. With parliament and socialists preparing to reassert their control against an increasingly authoritarian monarchy, it appears the instability that the country spent decades to avoid has finally reached its shores. Will Britain be able to reassert its influence on the world stage? Or will the sun finally set on the British Empire."
 FPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the forces of reaction sweeps away all advancements and progress at the establishment of the Second Republic, the socialists were overthrown. However, the movement never truly ended, as one can never stop the spirit of the working class. In a day of triumpant glory, the red banner was hoisted above Paris once again, and the German imperialists were expelled from the nation. \nDespite the grand triumph, very few agreements can be made between the various factions, and none are willing to compromise. The deadlock must be broken; and once it is, there will no turning back."
 RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It seemed as though the Russian eagle has been ressurrected after the defeat of the Reds in the Russian Civil War and the founding of a republic. Despite this, centries of absolute monarchism could not be wiped away easily, and Kerensky's republic was wholefully unprepared to handle the fallout. \nNow, radicals are widespread all across, paramilitary rule is all too typical, and the Duma resembles a yelling match than a functional parliament. While none can agree on a course of action, all can agree on one fact - The Russian Republic, in its current shape and form, cannot survive the impending storm."
 OTO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire, once regarded as the sick man of Europe, seems to have healed after its victory in the Great War. Its domains streches from the sand of Libyato the mountains of Armenia, its rule over the middle east unchallanged. \nYet underneath the bandage of victory lies a terminal illness that cannot be cursed without major reform by the Ottoman government. Seperatists plague the nation in every corning while an inept bureaucracy weakens the nation like a cancerous tumor. The frontiers hold numberous enemies each wishing to carve out a piece from this fragile empire."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan is a rapidly modernizing power in East Asia. The Land of the Rising Sun has been shadowed many times by its rivals across the sea. Joining the Great War and seizing French and British colonies in the Pacific. Japan saw itself in a powerful position to take advantage of a weakened China. However, Russian involvement humilitated the Japanese and saw numerous territorial concessions to China. \nEver since, Japan has been eyeing on Manchuria and other regions of China, ready to jump at its prey. SHall the warrior spirit carry the Japanese to victory? Or will it lose once more just like the times before."
